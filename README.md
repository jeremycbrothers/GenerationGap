# GenerationGap
This project was originally created by my self and various CS students who took CSCI-499</br>
with Dr. Adam Whitley. I will have made my own changes to this project that may not exist on the original. </br>
At this time Dr. Whitley does not have a license on the project but has given me permission to use the project in </br>
my portfolio. If the license changes to some variant open source license this should suffice as giving original credit.</br>
If the license changes I will remove this repository and all it's code at the original owners request.</br>
If you would like to see the state of the project made by the team please check out commit: 01fd1fdaa052d0faf5a089bb5a8cca94f52a1fff </br>
Note: I did remove some custom tools made by other students to avoid taking credit for work done outside the scope of the game. </br></br>

Quick tutorial:</br>
Character movement:</br>
- A/D - left/right movement</br>
- Spacbar - jump</br>
- Left mouse button - attack</br>
- Left Shift - sprint</br>
  
The character can jump on an enemy as a second attack.
